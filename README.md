# Titanic Machine Learning

My notebook following the course [Kaggle Python Tutorial on Machine Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning#gs.=IXCXgA) on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

This is a course for understanding the basics of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), using the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) challenge as a quick start tutorial.

### Install

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information) installer with Python 3.

### Execute

Clone the repository, and run `jupyter notebook` on the project's root directory.

Jupyter will automatically be opened on your browser at `localhost:8888/`.
